"""
Tests for the Telegram download stall-watchdog in bot_core._download_to_path.

This is the direct fix for a real incident: a download hung with zero byte
progress for 10+ minutes past its own configured timeout, with no
self-recovery, requiring a manual service restart. These tests simulate
that exact failure mode (a transfer that never writes any bytes) and verify
it's now caught and cleaned up automatically, plus that a normal transfer
completes untouched.

No real Telegram connection or data_dir isolation needed — _download_to_path
only touches the filesystem path it's given and a mocked bot.
